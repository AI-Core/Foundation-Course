The script that we run directly that imports from other modules is referred to as the __main module__. By splitting up our code like this, we are doing what is referred to as __modular programming!__\n",

At the end of the day, we may want more than to just re-use a few functions/classes here and there, and may actually want to create many functions/classes. Python helps us by allowing us to group many modules together in what is known as a __package__, essentially just a collection of different .py files with a particular functionality. Over time, many people in the Python community began to develop what are known as __Python libraries__, which are collections of related functionality of codes that allow you to perform many tasks without writing your code. These libraries are essentially a collection of packages and modules After all, why should we need to always create our own math functions if we can just re-use code developed by professionals with a simple import statement?\n",
