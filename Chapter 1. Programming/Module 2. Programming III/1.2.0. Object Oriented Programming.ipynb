In many cases our code can instead be more neatly organised on a conceptual level by grouping related functions together into what we call a __class__.

    "## Syntax Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Definition\n",
    "1. class keyword: indicates creation of class.\n",
    "2. ClassName: use PascalCase (no spaces, capitalised words) for naming classes, snake_case for functions/variables.\n",
    "3. Parentheses/colon: do not need parentheses, but add as a matter of style, add colon to end statement and indicate indent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Constructor\n",
    "4. \\_\\_init\\_\\_ is the first 'method' in the class, named the class constructor. This is called automatically when instance of class created. Note the 'def' keyword is the same as functions, and it has parameters like functions, BUT it is a __METHOD__.\n",
    "5. The first argument for \\_\\_init\\_\\_ is 'self' by convention, this is used to refer to each instance of a class (how Python distinguishes one instance of a class from another).\n",
    "6. The arguments for \\_\\_init\\_\\_ define the inputs assigned to each class instance.\n",
    "7. Can define defaults for these parameters e.g. param2 = 1, BUT default arguments cannot be followed by non-default arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "8. Attributes are typically assigned using \\_\\_init\\_\\_ parameters with the self conventional keyword.\n",
    "9. Hence we use the syntax self.param = param to assign attributes.\n",
    "10. Attributes do not require () when called as they are not executable.\n",
    "11. We can define attributes using other attributes as shown with self.param3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "12. Methods are defined as functions within a class.\n",
    "13. They perform operations based on inputs as defined by attributes.\n",
    "14. Whether or not a method takes any external parameters, the first parameter of a method is always self.\n",
    "15. When referencing attributes, we must reference instance: self.param1, NOT param1.\n",
    "16. Methods can take external arguments such as ext_input: these must be specified when calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining Attributes using Methods\n",
    "17. We can have attributes that are not defined by parameters of \\_\\_init\\_\\_.\n",
    "18. These can be defined as being empty or zero for example.\n",
    "19. We can then define them later using a method.\n",
    "20. For example, some_other_method takes in ext_input1 and ext_input2 and uses them to define self.param4."

Instead of functions, we can break out our code further into class definitions with the appropriate methods, as we have seen above. Once a class is defined, we can use as many instances of that class as we would like. OOP also provides us with abstraction, as we do not need to know exactly what is written inside a class definition, all we need to know is its __internal representation__ (attributes), and understand how the __interface__ (methods) works. As we have seen in previous lessons, we do not need to know the underlying code used to make lists work to be able to work objects of type list and their corresponding methods."

This is very useful in grouping similar things together, which we as humans often find logical to do and saves us from re-writing lots of code. Web-developers don't need to write a specific blocks of code for every separate button on their website, but rather can define a 'Button' class with different attributes (e.g. color, size, text). Likewise, if we wanted to develop a veterinary database that stores information on dogs, we shouldn't need to write a paragraph for each dog, but rather instances of a Dog class with different attributes (e.g. breed, size, weight).\n",

But doesn't that feel a bit inneficcient? After all, a LabradorRetriever object is just a Dog object with the 'breed' attribute set to \"Labrador Retriever\".

In this case, Dog is the __superclass/parent class/base class__, as it is the class whose behaviour and internal representation is inherited, whereas Labrador Retriever is the __subclass/child class/derived class__, as it is the class that inherits from the parent class. In practice, any class can be made into a parent class, and a parent class can have more than just one child class, and is known as __hierarchical inheritance__. For instace, we could use Dog as a parent class, and make a child class as we did for LabradorRetriever for every other dog breed, as we see below.\n",

    "- \\__call\\__: This method is called when the instance of the given class is called like a function! In the case of the LinearFunction, the __call__ method gives us the value of f(x) for a given input argument, x\n",
    "- \\__str\\__: This method is called when the str() or print() methods are called with an instance of the class as the argument. The output string/what is printed is whatever is returned by the \\__str\\__ method we define. In our case, we want the output printed to be of the form 'f(x) = mx + c', where m and c are replaced with the actual attribute values of the given instance\n",
    "- \\__add\\__: This method is called when the '+' operator is used between two instances of the class at hand. For the LinearFunction class, we want the the addition of two LinearFunction type objects to return another LinearFunction type object such that the new $m$ is the sum of the $m$s of the two objects and the new $c$ is the sum of the $c$s of the two objects"
