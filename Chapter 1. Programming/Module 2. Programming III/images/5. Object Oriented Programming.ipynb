In many cases our code can instead be more neatly organised on a conceptual level by grouping related functions together into what we call a __class__. Classes are like object constructors, or rather like a blueprint for creating objects. But what exactly does this mean?

    "## Syntax Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Definition\n",
    "1. class keyword: indicates creation of class.\n",
    "2. ClassName: use PascalCase (no spaces, capitalised words) for naming classes, snake_case for functions/variables.\n",
    "3. Parentheses/colon: do not need parentheses, but add as a matter of style, add colon to end statement and indicate indent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Constructor\n",
    "4. \\_\\_init\\_\\_ is the first 'method' in the class, named the class constructor. This is called automatically when instance of class created. Note the 'def' keyword is the same as functions, and it has parameters like functions, BUT it is a __METHOD__.\n",
    "5. The first argument for \\_\\_init\\_\\_ is 'self' by convention, this is used to refer to each instance of a class (how Python distinguishes one instance of a class from another).\n",
    "6. The arguments for \\_\\_init\\_\\_ define the inputs assigned to each class instance.\n",
    "7. Can define defaults for these parameters e.g. param2 = 1, BUT default arguments cannot be followed by non-default arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "8. Attributes are assigned using \\_\\_init\\_\\_ parameters with the self conventional keyword.\n",
    "9. Hence we use the syntax self.param = param to assign attributes.\n",
    "10. Attributes do not require () when called as they are not executable.\n",
    "11. We can define attributes using other attributes as shown with self.param3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "12. Methods are defined as functions within a class.\n",
    "13. They perform operations based on inputs as defined by attributes.\n",
    "14. Whether or not a method takes any external parameters, the first parameter of a method is always self.\n",
    "15. When referencing attributes, we must reference instance: self.param1, NOT param1.\n",
    "16. Methods can take external arguments such as ext_input: these must be specified when calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining Attributes using Methods\n",
    "17. We can have attributes that are not defined by parameters of \\_\\_init\\_\\_.\n",
    "18. These can be defined as being empty or zero for example.\n",
    "19. We can then define them later using a method.\n",
    "20. For example, some_other_method takes in ext_input1 and ext_input2 and uses them to define self.param4."

    "Just as with functions, we also achieve decomposition and abstraction with OOP. Instead of functions, we can break out our code further into class definitions with the appropriate methods, as we have seen above. Once a class is defined, we can use as many instances of that class as we would like. OOP also provides us with abstraction, as we do not need to know exactly what is written inside a class definition, all we need to know is its __internal representation__ (attributes), and understand how the __interface__ (methods) works. As we have seen in previous lessons, we do not need to know the underlying code used to make lists work to be able to work objects of type list and their corresponding methods."

If we wanted to work on a veterinary database that stores information on dogs, we shouldn't need to write a paragraph for each dog, but rather instances of a Dog class with different attributes (e.g. breed, size, weight). Web-developers don't need to write a specific blocks of code for every separate button on their website, but rather can create a 'Button' class and have different attributes (e.g. color, size, text).
