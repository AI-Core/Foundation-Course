    "### Note: Brief description of iterables in Python\n",
    "<br>An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time, permitting it to be iterated over in a loop. Most of the objects of Python are iterable. All the sequences like Python String, Python List, Python Dictionary etc are iterable. Strings have some characters as its members and we can iterate its members in a loop.
