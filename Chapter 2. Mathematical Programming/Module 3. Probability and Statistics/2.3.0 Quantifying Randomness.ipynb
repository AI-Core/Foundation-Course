    "__Probability__ is a measure of how likely an outcome is to occur given all other possible outcomes and the given circumstances. Therefore, when dealing with random variables, we do not concern ourselves with __what will happen__, but instead with __the probability of given outcome(s), also known as events, occuring__. Probability is formally defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Probability of an outcome} = \\frac{\\text{Number of wanted outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, we know that the probability of something occurring has to be somewhere between 0, where the outcome _cannot_ occur, and 1, where the outcome _will_ occur, where everything else is somewhere in between. We can apply probability in the context of the likelihood of a random variable taking a value or being within a range of values."
