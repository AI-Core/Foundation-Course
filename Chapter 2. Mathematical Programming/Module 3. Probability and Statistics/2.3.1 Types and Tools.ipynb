    "# Joint Probability Distributions\n",
    "After we learned about probability distributions and measures to describe them in the last chapter, we will now focus on different types of distributions.<br>\n",
    "Joint probability is the probability of two events occurring at the same time. In general, the notation for two events $A$ and $B$ happening together is $P(A\\cap B)$, which means it is the intersection of these two events as illustrated below:<br>\n",

    "In general, we can think of the joint probability as the probability of A __and__ B or as their intersection. <br>\n",
    "For example, in a deck of cards we can define as event A drawing a red card and as event B drawing a 6. In a deck of 52 cards, we will have 26 red cards s.t. $P(A) =  \\frac{26}{53}$ and 4 cards with the number 10 s.t. $P(B) = \\frac{4}{52}$.\n",
    "This probability can be calculated using the conditional probability:\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B) = P(B|A) P(A)$$\n",
    "The two formulas are equal because joint probability distributions are symmetrical s.t. $P(A \\cap B) = P(B \\cap A)$.\n",

    "# Marginal Probability Distributions\n",
    "We might not always know the individual probability distributions of $X$ and $Y$. Instead, it can happen that we are only given their joint probability distribution. We can then calculate the individual probability distributions or $X$ and $Y$ as the __mariginal distributions __of the joint distributions. This will make more sense, if we visualise the joint probability distribution in a table. Let's say we have to random variables $X$ and $Y$ that can both take two values, 0 and 1, for simplicity:<br>\n",

    "# Conditional Probability Distributions\n",
    "Beyond the joint occurrence of two events, we are also interested in the occurrence of an event __given__ that another event occurred. Sometimes, the probability of an event can change depending on whether another event occurred. Formally, it is denoted as $P(X|Y)$ and calculated as follows based on the product rule:\n",
    "$$ P(X|Y) = P(X \\cap Y) P(Y)$$\n",
    "On this note, we should also distinguish between __dependent and independent events__. If an event is independent of another event, it means that its outcome is not influenced by the outcome of the other event. This could for example be throwing of a die as the outcome of the first throw does not affect the outcome of the second throw. __Dependent events__ on the other hand are affected by other events. Let's take as an example drawing marbles from a bag. If we have a bag of 5 marbles, 3 of them being red and 2 being blue, the probability of drawing a red marble changes once we have drawn a marble without replacing it. This behaviour also affects the conditional probability. If two events are independent of another, we can calculate the conditional as follows:\n",
    "$$ P(X|Y) = P(X)$$ and vice versa. We can also use this formula to check for the independene of two random variables. If this formula holds, they are independent. Otherwise, they are dependent.<br>\n",
    "Furthermore, we can also distinguish events on whether they are __mutually exlusive__. In this case, once event $X$ has occurred, event $Y$ cannot occur anymore. Formally, they are also denoted as __disjoint events__ s.t.\n",
